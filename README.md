# iOS Weather App #

This is a simple weather app made for educational purposes by a Sorbonne University undergraduate student (L3 DANT).  
Supervised by [Adrien Humilière](mailto:adhumi+dant@gmail.com).

## Presentation ##
This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides two endpoints and
a JSON file that we will use in this app :  
  
* [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) for getting current weather in a location  
* [Five days forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) for getting a five-day forecast in a location  
* [Cities list JSON](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/) for searching a city  

## Features ##

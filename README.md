# iOS Weather App #

This is a simple weather app made for educational purposes by a Sorbonne University undergraduate student (L3 DANT).  
Supervised by [Adrien Humilière](mailto:adhumi+dant@gmail.com).

## Presentation ##
This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides two endpoints that we
will use in this app :
* [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) for getting current weather in a location.
* [Five days forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) for getting a five-day forecast in a location.

## Features ##
